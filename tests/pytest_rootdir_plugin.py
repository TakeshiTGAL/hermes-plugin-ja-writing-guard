"""pytest plugin (loaded with -p from pytest.ini); Hermes never imports this file.

The repo root is the plugin package itself: Hermes loads ``__init__.py``, which uses
relative imports. pytest 8 would import that ``__init__.py`` as a standalone module
(the directory name has hyphens) and fail, so collect the root as a plain directory.
tests/conftest.py loads the package the way Hermes does.
